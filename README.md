I <3 penguins

## About

No, really. Penguins are awesome. I like 'em so much I spent an afternoon pulling out the penguins from [Twilight Forest](https://github.com/Benimatic/twilightforest) into a stand-alone mod. I'll hopefully rewrite the code and all that one day, but really, it was after another day of "oh man, this minecraft server with TF on it isn't working properly, maybe it's TF?" and me going "well, that sucks, but look, I really want some penguins in minecraft. I'm going to just take 'em out of TF." 

Also, my MCP setup feels really messy so I'm uploading this for some clarity and versioning.

## Coding

I followed the [Forge wiki documentation](http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Source) on setting up a dev env. That should get you started.
